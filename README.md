### Features
* Its main purpose is to help visualize how to calculate the vector addition, using the [Parallelogram Law of Vector Addition](https://www.cuemath.com/calculus/parallelogram-law-of-vector-addition/).
* Given the coordinates of the 2 vectors, the resulting vector is calculated dinamically.
* The help lines are the imaginary parallels used to visualize the parallelogram that is formed.
* The coordinates of both the vectors, and the resulting vector are displayed and updated on the spot, together with the calculated distance.
